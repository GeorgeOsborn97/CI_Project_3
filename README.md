___
## Technology that was utilized:
### languages:
* python
### external assets utilized:
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/)
___
## testing:
In order to test responsive elements throughout the development process Chrome Devtools was used frequently.
 
### Manual Testing:
#### Feature Testing:
* Fixes refers to any potential current fixes/improvements that are still potentially available. 'None required' refers to the fact that at this moment there is no additional work needed to improve that feature. Many bugs and errors were encounted during the development process and several of these features were very much trail and error. The accounts of which can be found throughout the commits in GitHub.
* Background image: 
   - What was expected? The background image should not be distracting, in focus and on desktop the image should slowly zoom in for a period of 5 minutes before resetting.
   - How it was tested? The site was given to a number of people to gauge their reactions, none of them stated that they were distracted by the background whilst playing the game. The zoom effect was also watched to completion to ensure that it did reset after 5 minutes.
   - What was the outcome?
   The background worked as intended. it provides a fitting setting for the game whilst not distracting the user.
   - Fixes? None required.
   
#### Device testing:
This site has been physically tested on:
   - ASUS ZenBook
   - Iphone X
   - Samsung Galaxy S20

After the initial deployment these are the bugs that needed addressing:
   1. The UFO was loading off screen on mobile. This was solved by floating the box div over to the left and reducing it to 1px by 1px.
   2. There was an oversight as I did not initially think of how I was going to open the keyboard on mobile. There was many attempts at ways to force open the keyboard but they did work unfortunatly. In the end the fix for this was to create an input that the user could interactive with to open the keyboard on mobile.
   3. The input that was made in order to force open a mobile keyboard had one big issue. The screen zoomed in on the input when it was selected. The user was then required to zoom back out or scroll up to see the keys to be pressed. I have since put in a maximum-scale into the viewport meta, this has stopped the zooming effect.
