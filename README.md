# DND Character Creator

![full-mockup]()
This site has been designed to be a full character creator for DND 5e. However due to time constraints this initail plan has had to be cut down. This site is now here to provide people an insight into what kind of characters are possible within the world of DND. THis site provides a lot of information on different Races, Classes and spells. Although many mechanics of the game are only touched upon and not everything makes it into the character sheet presented at the end, the user should end their time here with atleast an understanding of what the different Races and Classes offer, an insight into what a character at any level may look like and what abilities they may have at each level. This is a site that could be infinitly expanded upon. As you'll see below I have an extensive roadmap of new features and mechanics that can be implemented in the future. It is a shame I could not complete the whole character creator at this time. But this certainly should help potential players get a bitof prior knowledge and hopefully help them in tehir decision of what character they will play, should they go on to join a campaign.
